#### Paper's Abstract:
T cells are key players in our defence against infections and malignancies. When T cells differentiate or become activated, they undergo substantial alterations in gene expression. Even though RNA expression levels are now well documented throughout different stages of T cells, it is not well understood how mRNA expression translates into the protein landscape. By combining paired RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry data of primary human CD8+ T cells, we report that mRNA expression is a poor proxy for the overall protein output, irrespective of the differentiation or activation status. Yet, gene class stratification revealed a function-specific correlation of mRNA with protein expression. This gene class-specific expression pattern associated with differences in gene characteristics such as sequence conservation and untranslated region (UTR) lengths. In addition, the presence of AU-rich elements in the 3â€™UTR associated with alterations in mRNA and protein abundance T cell activation dependent, gene class-specific manner. In conclusion, our study highlights the role of gene characteristics as a determinant for gene expression in T cells.
